##API

!method: forge.calendar.addEvent(options, success, error)
!platforms: iOS, Android
!param: options `object` parameters to define the event
!param: success `function(eventId)`
!param: error `function(content)` called with details of any error which may occur
!description: Show a UI that allows the user to add a calendar event, with certain properties pre-filled.

The properties that can be set on the options object are:

* ``title``: The title of the event
* ``description``: The event description (appears as notes on iOS)
* ``location``: The location of the event
* ``start``: The time the event starts (a JavaScript ``Date`` object)
* ``end``: The time the event ends (a JavaScript ``Date`` object)
* ``allday``: A boolean value that determines whether the event is an
   all day event (the time of day in the start and end will be ignored
   in all day events)
* ``recurring``: Whether the event is recurring and how often, one of:
   ``not``, ``daily``, ``weekly``, ``monthly``, or ``yearly``. If not
   specified the event will not recur.

> ::Warning:: On Android the eventId which is returned is the ID of the most recently added event, if another event happened to be added before the user returned to your app this ID could be incorrect.

**Example:**

	forge.calendar.addEvent({
		title: "Anniversary of adding my first event",
		start: new Date(),
		end: new Date(),
		allday: true,
		recurring: "yearly"
	}, function () {

> ::Warning:: On many Android devices there is a bug with the UI to edit calendar events which means the user will be shown the event but will be unable to edit most fields. This API method is only really safe to use on iOS, if you want the user to be able to edit events on Android then you should create your own UI using forge.calendar.getEvent and forge.calendar.updateEvent.
